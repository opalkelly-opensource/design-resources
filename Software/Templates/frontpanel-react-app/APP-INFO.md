This app is a basic template to use when starting a new FrontPanel Platform project. In addition to providing the scaffolding for a fully-functional application, the template includes:

* **App Manifest** - An example of the FrontPanel application manifest to communicate app characteristics to the launcher.
* **FPGA Configuration** - Example source code for configuring the FPGA for an application with multiple device compatibility.
* **Work Queue** - Example source code demonstrating how to use the work queue for managing single-threaded communication with the device in the asynchronous execution environment of the browser.
* **Timer Polling** - Example source code demonstrating how to implement timer polling for real-time device telemetry updates.

## Usage

The template app gateware has a simple counter implementation. The GUI provides real-time telemetry updates of that counter for demonstration purposes.

## Version History

* 1.0.0 (released 2025-08-26)
